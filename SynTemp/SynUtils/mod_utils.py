def smilesFromProduct(product: Any) -> str:
    """
    Converts a product object into a SMILES string by constructing a GML graph representation of the product.

    The function iterates over the vertices of the product, adding each vertex and its incident edges to a GML graph
    string. The GML string is then converted into a graph object, from which the SMILES representation is obtained.

    Parameters:
    - product (Any): The product object containing vertices and edges. The exact type of this object is not specified
                      and depends on the implementation of the graph and product structures.

    Returns:
    - str: The SMILES string representation of the product.

    Note: This function assumes the existence of a `graphGMLString` function that converts a GML string into a graph
          object with a `smiles` attribute. The precise nature of the `product` parameter and the `graphGMLString`
          function are abstracted and should be adapted to fit the specific context in which this function is used.
